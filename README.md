# Question: How do you implement a max heap or min heap from scratch? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is an implementation of a min heap data structure. The min heap is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its child node(s). The code defines a MinHeap class with a constructor that initializes an array with a null value. The class has two methods: insert and remove. The insert method adds a number to the heap and then reorders the heap to ensure the smallest number is at the root. This is done by comparing the inserted number with its parent and swapping them if the parent is larger. The remove method removes the smallest number (the root of the heap), replaces it with the last number in the heap, and then reorders the heap to ensure the smallest number is at the root. This is done by comparing the root with its children and swapping it with the smaller child if it is larger. The removed number is then returned. The code ends with an example of creating a new MinHeap object, inserting numbers into it, and then removing and printing them, which demonstrates that the numbers are removed in ascending order.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is more structured and modular compared to the JavaScript version. It breaks down the problem into smaller, more manageable methods, making the code easier to read and understand. 

In the TypeScript version, the heap is strongly typed as an array of numbers, which provides type safety and can prevent potential bugs related to incorrect data types. The TypeScript version also uses method signatures to specify the types of parameters and return values, which can help catch errors at compile time.

The TypeScript version introduces several helper methods such as `getLeftChildIndex`, `getRightChildIndex`, `getParentIndex`, `hasLeftChild`, `hasRightChild`, `hasParent`, `leftChild`, `rightChild`, and `parent`. These methods encapsulate the logic for navigating the heap, making the code more readable and maintainable.

The `swap` method in the TypeScript version encapsulates the logic for swapping two elements in the heap. This makes the code cleaner and reduces duplication.

The `peek` method in the TypeScript version returns the smallest element in the heap without removing it. This method is not present in the JavaScript version.

The `poll` method in the TypeScript version removes the smallest element from the heap and reorders the heap to maintain the min heap property. This is similar to the `remove` method in the JavaScript version, but the TypeScript version uses the `heapifyDown` method to reorder the heap, which makes the code more modular.

The `add` method in the TypeScript version adds an element to the heap and reorders the heap to maintain the min heap property. This is similar to the `insert` method in the JavaScript version, but the TypeScript version uses the `heapifyUp` method to reorder the heap, which makes the code more modular.

The `heapifyUp` and `heapifyDown` methods in the TypeScript version encapsulate the logic for maintaining the min heap property after adding or removing elements. These methods make the code more modular and reusable.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution also creates a MinHeap class with methods to insert and remove elements. The insert method adds an element to the heap and reorders the heap to maintain the min heap property. The deleteKey method removes an element from the heap, reorders the heap to maintain the min heap property. The getMin method returns the smallest element from the heap (the root).

The main differences between the JavaScript and C++ versions are:

1. Language Syntax: JavaScript uses a more modern, concise syntax with features like destructuring assignment for swapping elements. C++ uses a more traditional syntax with explicit type declarations and separate lines for each operation.

2. Recursion vs Iteration: The C++ version uses recursion in the heapify_up and heapify_down methods to reorder the heap after an insert or remove operation. The JavaScript version uses while loops for the same purpose.

3. Array Manipulation: JavaScript has built-in methods like push, splice, and length for manipulating arrays. C++ uses methods like push_back, pop_back, and size on the vector class, which is similar to an array but with more features.

4. Error Handling: The JavaScript version checks if the heap is empty and returns null if a remove operation is attempted on an empty heap. The C++ version does not include any error handling for this case.

5. Method Names: The JavaScript version uses the method name "remove" to delete the smallest element from the heap. The C++ version uses the method name "deleteKey" for the same operation.

6. Accessing the Minimum Element: In JavaScript version, the minimum element is returned when the remove method is called. In C++, the minimum element can be accessed anytime using the getMin method without modifying the heap.
